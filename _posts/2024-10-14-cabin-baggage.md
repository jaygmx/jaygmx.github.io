When packing for international travel with a focus on cabin baggage, it's important to prioritize essential items, travel documents, and convenience, while keeping in mind the restrictions on liquids, electronics, and size/weight. For a one-month trip, here's a guide on what to pack in your cabin baggage:

### Tips for Cabin Baggage:
   - **Pack light and versatile items**: Cabin baggage space is limited. Make sure each item is multipurpose or necessary for the flight or first day of your trip.
   - **Weigh your bag**: Ensure your bag adheres to the airline’s weight limits (typically between 7–10 kg).
   - **Security compliance**: Ensure all liquids are within the allowable limits, electronics are easily accessible for screening, and any battery-powered devices comply with airline regulations.

These essentials should ensure you're well-prepared for the journey and comfortable during the flight, while also covering immediate needs if your checked luggage gets delayed.
